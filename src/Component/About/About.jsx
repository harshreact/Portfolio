                        <h5>I am Harsh Patel, born and raised in Ahmedabad. I come from a nuclear family and have completed my schooling at Asia English School under the CBSE board. I pursued my graduation in Computer Science and Engineering from New LJ Institute of Engineering and Technology.<br/><br/>I have a deep passion for working with data and visualizing insights through graphs, which has led me to develop a strong interest in Machine Learning and Data Science. I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, and ReactJS. Currently, I am also working on a startup idea focused on elder care under the organization Saathi Care.<br/><br/>I am always eager to learn new things and delve deeper into subjects that intrigue me. Beyond academics and professional pursuits, I have a keen interest in mythological shows and movies, particularly those based on Indian mythology. Additionally, I enjoy playing cricket and football, which help me stay active and engaged outside of my studies and work.</h5>
